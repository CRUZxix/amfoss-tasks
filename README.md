# SELF INTRO
Hello, I'm Thejus Krishna from the Amrita School of Engineering's S3 Mechanical Branch.Since my fifth-grade teachers introduced me to html, i have been fascinated with coding.Just as einstein said "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious".My initial drive to discover how to code was purely curiosity.
# INTROSPECTION
# Why should we choose you?
I appreciate and find it intriguing to learn ever-new codes and languages to solve problems.I've only dabbled in the vast area of programming and development. I believe that amfoss will help me reach my full potential and introduce me to the world of advanced programming.I also have faith in my ability to adjust to and manage any situations that arise. I think I'll be a fantastic addition to your team.
# What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them?
My main objective for the upcoming six months is to improve my coding knowledge and analytical skills. Here's how I intend to do it:

Continuous Learning: Through online classes on platforms like Coursera and edX, I'll keep up with the latest programming languages, algorithms, and data structures.

Coding Challenges: Regular practice on tools like LeetCode to hone problem-solving abilities.

More personal coding projects should be made to gain practical experience.

Open Source: Participating actively in open-source projects to get knowledge from seasoned developers.

Online Courses: Enrolling in programs that address my interests, such as web development or machine learning.

Competitions: taking part in hackathons and coding contests like Google Code Jam.

Networking: Participating in coding groups and interacting with other developers to gain knowledge and collaborate.
# How will you contribute back to the club?
 I'll support the club by showing up to meetings on time, pitching in on initiatives, and promoting the group's events. In order to elevate the club to its highest potential, I will always give any task I am given my all.
